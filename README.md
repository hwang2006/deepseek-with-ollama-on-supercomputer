# deepseek-with-ollama-on-supercomputer

Everyone seems to be talking about DeepSeek-R1, the recently released AI reasoning model from a Chinese AI startup DeepSeek. This model has gained significant attention for its comparable performance to leading AI models like OpenAI's o1 reasoning model. It is open-source and free to use, allowing users to download, modify, and run it for free for their own purpose.

This repository is intended to share and promote how to run and test DeepSeek-R1 using ollama on a SLRUM-managed supercomputer. [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) provides a lightweight framework for downloading and running AI models locally, making it easier to deploy and manage AI models on local machines. It is available for macOS, Linux, and Windows.

## KISTI Neuron GPU Cluster
Neuron is a KISTI GPU cluster system consisting of 65 nodes with 260 GPUs (120 of NVIDIA A100 GPUs and 140 of NVIDIA V100 GPUs). [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/) is adopted for cluster/resource management and job scheduling.

## Installing Conda
Once logging in to Neuron, you will need to have either [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed on your scratch directory. Anaconda is distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing, aiming to simplify package management and deployment. Anaconda comes with +150 data science packages, whereas Miniconda, a small bootstrap version of Anaconda, comes with a handful of what's needed.

1. Check the Neuron system specification
```
[glogin01]$ cat /etc/*release*
CentOS Linux release 7.9.2009 (Core)
Derived from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.8 (Source)
NAME="CentOS Linux"

cpe:/o:centos:centos:7
```

2. Download Anaconda or Miniconda. Miniconda comes with python, conda (package & environment manager), and some basic packages. Miniconda is fast to install and could be sufficient for distributed deep learning training practices. 
```
# (option 1) Anaconda 
[glogin01]$ cd /scratch/$USER  ## Note that $USER means your user account name on Neuron
[glogin01]$ wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2022.10-Linux-x86_64.sh --no-check-certificate
```
```
# (option 2) Miniconda 
[glogin01]$ cd /scratch/$USER  ## Note that $USER means your user account name on Neuron
[glogin01]$ wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh --no-check-certificate
```

3. Install Miniconda. By default conda will be installed in your home directory, which has a limited disk space. You will install and create subsequent conda environments on your scratch directory. 
```
[glogin01]$ chmod 755 Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
[glogin01]$ ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

Welcome to Miniconda3 py39_4.12.0

In order to continue the installation process, please review the license
agreement.
Please, press ENTER to continue
>>>                               <======== press ENTER here
.
.
.
Do you accept the license terms? [yes|no]
[no] >>> yes                      <========= type yes here 

Miniconda3 will now be installed into this location:
/home01/qualis/miniconda3        

  - Press ENTER to confirm the location
  - Press CTRL-C to abort the installation
  - Or specify a different location below

[/home01/qualis/miniconda3] >>> /scratch/$USER/miniconda3  <======== type /scratch/$USER/miniconda3 here

installation finished.
Do you wish to update your shell profile to automatically initialize conda?
This will activate conda on startup and change the command prompt when activated.
If you'd prefer that conda's base environment not be activated on startup,
   run the following command when conda is activated:

conda config --set auto_activate_base false

You can undo this by running `conda init --reverse $SHELL`? [yes|no]
[no] >>> yes         <========== type yes here
.
.
.
no change     /scratch/qualis/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.csh
modified      /home01/qualis/.bashrc

==> For changes to take effect, close and re-open your current shell. <==

Thank you for installing Miniconda3!
```

4. finalize installing Miniconda with environment variables set including conda path

```
[glogin01]$ source ~/.bashrc    # set conda path and environment variables 
[glogin01]$ conda config --set auto_activate_base false
[glogin01]$ which conda
/scratch/$USER/miniconda3/condabin/conda
[glogin01]$ conda --version
conda 23.9.0
```

## Creating a Conda Virtual Environment
You want to create a virtual envrionment with a python version 3.10 for Generative AI Practices.
```
[glogin01]$ conda create -n deepseek python=3.11
